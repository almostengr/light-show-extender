# Falcon Pi Twitter

This project is designed for Falcon Pi Player to provide updates via Twitter on the light show that 
you are running. Those updates include posting the current song and providing alerts when problems
are detected.

This application is designed to run on Falcon Pi Players that are installed on Raspberry Pi. However, it is
possible to get it running on Beagle Bone Black devices.

## Problem

I wanted a way for viewers of my Christmas light show to be able to find out the song information 
about the show.  In addition, I wnated to have an online presence for the show. 

## Solution

I created this Falcon PI Twitter applicatoin that will monitor the Falcon Pi Player that runs my 
Christmas light show. This monitor gets the status ando ther information based on the Falcon Pi Player
via the FPP API.
