# Light Show Extender

## Problem

I wanted to have a way that visitors to the light show would be able to interact with the light show. While researching what others were doing, I found a way for this to be done.

## Solution

I found a project called Remote Falcon that allows visitors to do some of the similar things that I wanted. However, it did lack some features. Remote Falcon is maintained by one of the individuals in the light show community. It is a personal project of his and he does not charge fees for the service. I debated with whether to fork the existing repository and make changes to the existing code, but it was apprehensive about doing so.

What I decided to do was to create my own jukebox implementation of the light show using my website. My implementation of this project, was designed to have only the features that I desired to be included. This mainly consisted of users being able pick one of the songs that that they wanted to hear and the Falcon Pi Player, play those songs in the order in which they were requested.
